Key features:

The game combines elements of a text game (interactive fiction) or visual novel with point-and-click mechanics, allowing you to interact with the environment through text links.

Game controls:

The game is completely controlled by mouse or controller. Simply place the cursor on the highlighted active text and select one or two interaction options.

The game screen is divided into three main areas:

The top of the screen: Here you will find illustrations and room descriptions. There are three icons:

Quest log: Keep track of your quests.
Interactive map: Allows quick travel to distant rooms.
Game menu: In-game menu.

Action window in the middle: Shows all actions performed and the results of interactions.

Inventory at the bottom: Here you can examine items, apply them to other items in the action window, in the room description or directly in your inventory.

You can use the mouse wheel to scroll through the quest log.
On the map, you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Click on the room you want to go to (if possible) to activate 'fast travel' to that room.

Keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation:

A, W, S, D or cursor arrows: Leave the room in the desired direction
SPACE: access the map
TAB: Open the quest log
F5: Quick save
F8: Quick load
